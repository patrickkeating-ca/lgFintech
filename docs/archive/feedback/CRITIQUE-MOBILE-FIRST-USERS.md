# Critique: Mobile-First User Perspective
*Date: December 23, 2025*

## User Personas Context

**Marcus Rodriguez** (IT Manager, 30s)
- $67K vest (600 shares PSU)
- Heavy Bitcoin holder - comfortable with instant crypto execution
- Uses: Robinhood, Cash App
- Mobile-first for all banking

**Alex Chen** (VP Content Strategy, 30s)
- $384K vest (3,430 shares RSU)
- Frequent traveler - relies on laptop/mobile
- Uses: Fidelity, Intuit, dating apps
- Mobile-first, needs airport-friendly UX

**Demo audience = more Alex than Marcus**

## Marcus's Take (IT Manager, $67K vest)

### What Works ✅
- Clean, premium UI vs Robinhood's basic interface
- Stock ticker layout familiar from trading apps
- Timeline swipeable - mobile native pattern
- Clear money amount upfront

### What's BS ❌
- **Why don't I get Fred's number?** Feels like coach vs first class
- **Bitcoin gives me instant control** - Where's my "Execute 60/40" button?
- **"Add to Calendar" badge that does nothing** = annoying tease
- **Too much scrolling** for simple question: "What do I do on Feb 6?"
- **I use Cash App/Robinhood** - instant action. This feels like I still have to call someone
- No execution path = doesn't match my crypto experience

---

## Alex's Take (VP, $384K vest, premium client)

### What Works ✅
- Phone number = VIP touch, feels premium
- Brokerage-style ticker - professional
- Fred's credentials visible - legitimacy established

### What's BS ❌
- **Advisor card doesn't SCREAM at me** - I'm scrolling past it
- **Where's my P&L from last vest?** Robinhood shows gain/loss immediately
- **Timeline: Do I care about September** when February is 48 days away?
- **Fred's generic avatar = placeholder vibes** - not premium enough
- **I'm on my phone at airport** - this requires too much scroll/tap to get to action
- **Schwab already has my money** - Where's "Execute Fred's Plan" button?
- No immediate action = friction

---

## Real Talk: What's Missing

### Biggest Miss
**No execution path** - These are mobile-first, action-oriented users who expect:
- Robinhood: Tap → Execute
- Cash App: Tap → Send
- Crypto: Tap → Transfer
- This app: Read → ??? → Call someone?

### Critical for Demo Audience (Alexes)
1. **Fred needs real photo** or it screams prototype
2. **Advisor card buried** - needs MORE prominence
3. **Too much passive info, not enough "do this now"**
4. **No clear execution path** from recommendation to action

### The Gap
- **80% there on premium feel** ✅
- **20% there on action** ❌

---

## What Demo Audience Expects

**Alexes want:**
1. "Here's Fred's plan" ← Have this ✅
2. "Tap to execute" ← Don't have this ❌

**The "Do Now" Attitude:**
- Pre-filled trade ticket
- "Execute Fred's 70/30 Plan" button
- Confirmation, done
- Match the mobile-first execution model they live in

---

## Action Items to Consider

1. **Execution button** - "Execute Fred's Plan" (pre-filled trade)
2. **Real Fred photo** - stock photo of professional advisor
3. **Advisor card prominence** - can't be buried, must grab attention
4. **Reduce scroll** - critical info above fold for mobile
5. **P&L from previous vest** - show track record
6. **Actually wire up Calendar** - or remove badge
7. **Timeline focus** - next 3 events, not all 12

---

## Bottom Line

Premium feel is there. **Action is missing.**

For $1B entertainment client demo → audience is mobile-first Alexes who expect Robinhood-level instant execution, not "call your advisor."

**Differentiator should be:** Human advisor (Fred) + Instant execution = premium + modern
