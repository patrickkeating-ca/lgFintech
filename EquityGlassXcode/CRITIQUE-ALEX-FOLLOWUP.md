# Follow-Up Critique: Alex's Take (Round 2)
*Date: December 24, 2025*

## Context

**Alex Chen** (VP Content Strategy, 30s)
- $384K vest (3,430 shares RSU)
- Uses: Fidelity, Intuit, mobile-first for everything
- Previous feedback: "Where's my Execute button? Too much scroll, not enough action."

**What changed since last time:**
- "Execute Plan" button added to Fred's card
- Full execution flow built (Review → Confirm → Success)
- Dark mode support
- Liquid Glass animations

---

## What Works Now ✅

### Execution Path - FINALLY
**The big win.** Green "Execute Plan" button on Fred's card = exactly what I wanted.
- Shimmer effect catches my eye
- Two taps to execute (Review → Confirm)
- Pre-filled trade ticket shows where my money goes
- Success screen confirms it's done

**This is what I meant.** Robinhood-level instant execution, but with Fred's expertise baked in.

### Review Your Order Screen
Clean, clear, fast:
- 3,430 shares (RSU) upfront
- Calendar icon: Feb 6, 2026
- Clock icon: Market open
- Hold → Schwab Brokerage ...328
- Sell → Checking Acct ...582

**No guesswork.** I know exactly what's happening and where money goes.

### Dark Mode
On the plane, late at night, eyes don't get blown apart. **Table stakes, but you did it right.**

### Next Steps Section
"Coordinate DAF with Maria (Tax Specialist)" - shows Fred's plan extends beyond just the trade.
**Premium touch.** This is what I'm paying for - holistic advice.

### One-Tap T&C
"By tapping Confirm & Execute, you agree to Schwab's Terms..."
**Smart.** Legal compliance without friction. One button, done.

## What's Still BS ❌

### Fred's Photo - Actually Good Now ✅
**Correction: Fred's photo IS showing.**
- Professional advisor headshot
- Looks legitimate, premium
- This is what I wanted

**Scratch this complaint.** Photo is there and looks good.

### Timeline Still Shows 12 Events
I said: **"Do I care about September when February is 48 days away?"**

You said: "We'll focus timeline on next 3 events."

**Still showing all 12 events.** September advisor meeting is 9 months away. Why?
- I'm at the airport
- I have 5 minutes
- I need to know: What do I do NOW?

**Cut it to 3.** Next events only. "View All" if I want the rest.

### Too Much Scroll to Get to Execute
**Better, but not great:**
1. Stock header
2. 3 vests scheduled (collapsed - good)
3. Timeline carousel (12 cards - too many)
4. Vest amount card
5. **FINALLY - Fred's card with Execute button**
6. Tax breakdown

**I'm still scrolling past timeline to get to the action.**

If execution is the meat (your words), why is it below a 12-event timeline?

### No P&L from Last Vest
Robinhood shows gain/loss immediately. Fidelity shows performance.
**Where's my track record?**
- Last vest: Did I make money?
- Fred's last recommendation: How'd it perform?
- Build trust through results

### "View Trade Order" Button After Execution
After I execute, button changes to "View Trade Order" (gray).
**This is fine, but...**
- What if I want to see Fred's conversation again?
- The "View Trade Order" button opens the success screen
- But "Tap to view full conversation" text is still on the card
- Feels like two different actions competing

Minor, but confusing.

## The Three-Card Problem

You captured this in NEXT-ITERATION.md - **good instinct.**

**Current flow feels disjointed:**
1. Card: Vest amount ($384K)
2. Card: Fred's recommendation + Execute
3. Card: Tax breakdown

**It works, but doesn't flow.** Three separate cards = browsing, not executing.

**Premium should feel:**
- Single story: "Your vest → Fred's plan → Go"
- Less like a dashboard, more like a guided experience

I don't have the answer, but you're right to question it.

## What I'd Tell the Demo Audience

**"This nails the execution path."**
- Human advisor (Fred) tells me what to do
- I can execute it instantly from my phone
- No calling, no friction
- Success screen shows it's handled

**That's the differentiator.** Schwab's expertise + Robinhood's speed.

**But polish matters for $1B client:**
- Fred's placeholder photo undermines the premium feel
- Timeline noise buries the action
- Three-card layout works but doesn't wow

---

## Bottom Line

**Before:** 80% premium feel, 20% action
**Now:** 70% premium feel, 80% action

**You fixed the execution problem.** The "Execute Plan" button is exactly what I wanted.

**Some polish items remain:**
- Timeline is still 12 events when I asked for 3
- Scroll depth to Execute didn't improve (timeline still in the way)
- No P&L from previous vest

**For demo:** You can show instant execution now. That's huge.

**For $1B client:** Cut the timeline, add P&L badge, tighten the cards.

---

## Quick Wins Before Demo

1. **Timeline: Next 3 events only** - "View All" link if needed
2. **Consider moving timeline below execution** - put the meat first
3. **P&L badge** - "Last vest: +12.3%" somewhere visible
4. **Tighten card layout** - make vest → recommendation → execute feel like one story

**Execution flow is solid.** Now make the journey to that button premium.
