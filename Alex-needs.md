Excellent clarification. The surgeon is the product; the app is the operating room. It must be clean, precise, and showcase the surgeon's work effectively.

You're right. The magic is in how the app makes the advisor's custom strategy **visual and tactile**. Here’s how you do that:

1.  **Visualize the "Default" vs. "The Surgeon's Plan":**
    When Alex opens the app, he first sees the generic, unoptimized outcome. This is what would happen if he just let his brokerage "sell to cover." It’s the baseline, the "before" picture.

    Then, after the advisor has worked their magic, a new option appears: **"Fred's Custom Plan."** The app presents them side-by-side. The UI uses simple, powerful visuals to show the difference:
    *   A bigger pile of "cash in hand."
    *   A smaller, more efficient "tax withholding" block.
    *   A clear, top-line summary: **"Fred's plan gets you +$18,500 more upfront."**

2.  **Make the Advisor's Logic Tangible:**
    The plan isn't just numbers; it's the advisor's reasoning made visible.
    *   **Annotations:** The advisor can add small, contextual notes directly onto the visualization. A little tag on the tax bar might say: *"We're withholding an extra 5% here to account for the bonus you mentioned. This prevents a surprise bill in April."* This directly connects their conversation to the numbers on the screen.
    *   **The Killer Feature:** Imagine a 30-second video thumbnail next to the plan. Alex taps it, and it's a short, personal message from the advisor: *"Hi Alex, here is the strategy we discussed. I've weighted it toward maximizing your cash on hand for the down payment. Tap 'Approve' and my team and I will handle the rest."* This is the ultimate blend of human touch and digital convenience.

3.  **The "Approval" is the Key Interaction:**
    The primary button isn't "Execute"; it's **"Approve Plan."** The interaction should feel decisive and satisfying—a firm haptic buzz, a clear confirmation screen. Tapping it isn't a trade; it's an act of successful delegation. It's the digital version of a confident handshake, confirming "I trust you, handle it."

This way, the technology doesn't replace the advisor. It **amplifies their value**, making their expertise feel immediate, personal, and profoundly effective.
